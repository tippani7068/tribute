        <center><img src="gandhi.jpg" alt="Mahatma Gandhi" style="height: 200px;width: 150px;"></center>
        <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi, was a leader of the Indian independence movement against British colonial rule. Born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India, he became known for his nonviolent civil disobedience tactics.</p>
        <p>Gandhi's philosophy of nonviolence (Ahimsa) and his commitment to truth (Satyagraha) inspired millions and played a crucial role in India's struggle for freedom. His methods of peaceful resistance and civil disobedience were instrumental in achieving India's independence in 1947.</p>
        <p>One of his famous quotes is: <span id="quote">"You must be the change you want to see in the world."</span></p>
        <p>Throughout his life, Gandhi advocated for social justice, equality, and harmony among different communities. He was a symbol of hope and inspiration, not just for India but for people all around the world.</p>
